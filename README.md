# Juno Project 2: jobseekr

## Objective

To build an application in order to show an understanding of working with third-party APIs, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, error handling and UI design, and to demonstrate competence in pair programming and communication.

## Project Requirements

**Pair programming**
It is just as important to work well with your partner as it is to make a functional product. Both members of the team should have a complete understanding of the technical aspects of the project.

**Code**
- App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop down menu, search field)
- App and interactions are accessible
- It is clear to the user what the app does and results are displayed legibly
- App interacts with at least one API
- All code should be organized using a namespace object
- Modern ES6 variable declarations (let, const) are used correctly
- Site is live on Netlify
- Errors are handled effectively
- Naming convention throughout HTML and CSS is consistent (ie. kabob-case, camelCase, BEM, etc)
- Project is organized using Sass partials (minimum 3)
- Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
- Semantic HTML elements are used properly
- Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
- Do not use any external CSS libraries (i.e., Bootstrap)
- Site is responsive and uses media queries
- ID selectors should not be used to style elements

**Presentation**
You will be presenting your project on the day it's due:
- Identified one technical win
- Identified one technical challenge
